# Graph

Graph implementation using C++ language  
This project develops an object oriented application of a graph that represents a **Banking System** where the costumers represent the vertices while the transactions are edges.
The graph achieves the following function:  

1.  A graph can be empty with no vertex or edge;
2.  A graph can be either a directed graph or an undirected graph;
3.  A graph can be added in vertices and edges;
4.  A vertex of a graph can contain values;
5.  A graph can be displayed by listing all the possible paths, each linking vertices;
6.  A graph can be queried by given a starting vertex, listing the path this vertex leads;
7.  A graph can be queried by given an edge if this edge exists in the graph;
8.  A graph can be queried if a value is contained by any of its vertex;  

The inheritance, polymorphism and exception handling are also used in the code.
